ABANDONED
Now using the capsicain repo, which is the client only, as a VS project.

C++ tool that uses the Interception driver to monitor and modify keypresses, at a very low level.

AutoHotKey is nice but fails whenever the target gets key input from low level (VMs, RDP, security boxes).  
KeyTweak works better, but supports only basic key remapping, and requires a reboot for every change.

Features:
- optional basic key remapping (Y<>Z, WIN<>ALT on non-Apple keyboards, \ and / to Shift)
- CapsLock -> Cursor control layer 
    [I][J][K][L] = Cursor
    [Z][U] = Home/End
    [O][>] = PgUp/Down
    [H]['] = Backspace/Delete
    [N][M] = Ctrl+Left/Right
    [=] = Insert
    [P][[][]] = Print/ScrLock/Pause
    [ALT]+[Cursor] = 10 times
- CapsLock -> Clipboard functions
    [S][D][F] = Cut/Copy/Paste
    [Backspace] = Undo
    [Shift+Backspace] = Redo
- Tapping CapsLock (Press+ Release) -> Special character layer
    AOU = Ümläüte
    SEDC = ß€°©
- Special characters work more reliable with a corresponding AutoHotKey script active.
  (without AHK, ALT+NUMPAD codes are sent, not all apps support this)
- 10 Clipboards (requires AHK script)
  Caps+[0]..[9] copies to clipboard #n
  Tapping Caps + [0]..[9] pastes from clipboard #n
